DESIGN CHOICES:
1. An instance of Game is contained in the App class which is what starts the game. Hider is contained
within the Game class which allows a hider to be constructed, subsequently constructing a cloak,
a lily pad, and a seeker (all of which are contained in the Hider class).

2. Association was used in the Hider and Seeker classes. It was necessary so that the Seeker could
communicate with the Hider and get the last lilypad that the seker was just on, since Hider already contained
an instance of Seeker.
